Overview:
This directory contains code coupling COSP to the host model or environment.
COSP depends on this code, which must be edited before building COSP.
Editing could include referencing modules from the host model.

cosp_kinds.f90 specifies the numerical precision of all floating point variables.
The version provided here offers the choice of Fortran 90 intrinsics for
single (4 byte) and double (8 byte) precision, but the wp variable might also
point to a host model's definition imported from another module.

cosp_errorHandling.f90 contains a single routine, errorMessage, that accepts
a text string. The default implementation simply prints this string to
standard output. Users may want to replace this with the host model's error
reporting system.
