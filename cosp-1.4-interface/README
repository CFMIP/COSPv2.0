This directory contains a layer mapping COSP 1 inputs and outputs to
COSP 2. Users should, in principle, be able to compile cosp_interface_v1p4.F90
after building the rest of COSP 2, then call the routines in this module with
existing implementations of 1.4.

As the calling structure of COSP 2 differs substantially from previous versions
the translation of inputs and outputs requires copying substantial amounts of
data, and so isn't very efficient. Users are encouraged to move to direct
implementations of COSP 2 as time allows.
