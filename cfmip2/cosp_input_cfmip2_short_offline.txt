! Namelist that sets up CMOR-related variables.
! Configuration for CFMIP-2.
! CloudSat and CALIPSO/PARASOL simulators ON, to be run offline.
! Curtain and monthly gridded outputs from model curtain data.
! Parameters that define the model grid need to be defined appropriately by
! the modellers (NPOINTS,NLEVELS).
! NCOLUMNS is recommended to be ~ model resolution (in degrees) x 100,
! but not less than ~50
! (e.g 1x1 deg model => NCOLUMN=100)
! FINPUT will have to be defined/updated appropriately by the user
