Overview:
This directory contains example code on how to call COSP2. Provided are two interfaces, both
demonstrating different ways to call COSP2:

1) COSPv1.4 Interface (v1.4/)
   This driver makes use of the derived types and subroutines used in COSP1 and maps them
   onto COSP2 input/output structures. This allows the user to call COSP2 just as COSP1.
   Essentially, this driver can be thought of as a COSP1 wrapper around COSP2.
   *) cosp_test.f90           - Main testing code
   *) cosp_io.f90             - Module containing input/output subroutines (CMOR)
   *) cosp_input_nl.txt       - Input namelist 
   *) cosp_output_nl.txt      - Output namelist
   *) Makefile                - Makefile
   *) cosp_defs.h             - File needed for preprocessing step
   *) cosp_interface_v1p4.f90 - COSP1 wrapper   
2) COSPv2.0 (v2.0/)
   This driver illustrates how to directly call COSP2.
   *) cosp_test.f90      - Main driver code
   *) cosp_io.f90        - Module containing input/output subroutines (CMOR)
   *) cosp_input_nl.txt  - Input namelist
   *) cosp_output_nl.txt - Output namelist
   *) Makefile           - Makefile

*NOTE*
These makefiles build the interface to COSP, not COSP itself. Be sure to build build the
COSP2 source code PRIOR to building either of these sample the interfaces.

To build COSP2 from this directory:
   make cosp
You can also build COSP2 in the src/ directory:
   make install
