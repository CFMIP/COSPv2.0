Overview:
This directory contains source code to test COSP.
There are two codes here demonstrating teo different ways to call COSP:
1) Call to COSPv1.4 (cosp_test_v1.4.f90)
   This driver makes use of the derived types and subroutines used in
   COSPv1.4and maps them to v2.0 input/output structures. This allows
   the user to call COSP v2.0 the same way as v1.4. This driver
   can be thought of as a COSPv1.4 wrapper around COSPv2.0.
   *) cosp_test_v1.4.f90      - Main driver code
   *) cosp_io.v1.4.f90        - Input/output module for offline code
   *) cosp_input_nl.v1.4.txt  - Input namelist 
   *) cosp_output_nl.v1.4.txt - Output namelist
   *) Makefile.v1.4           - Makefile
   *) cosp_defs.h             - File needed for preprocessing
2) Call to COSPv2.0 (cosp_test_v2.0.f90)
   The call to COSPv2.0 requires the user to provide more fileds than
   in v1.4.0 (i.e. optical inputs). Many of the optical calculations
   in v1.4.0 were part of the simulators, but in v2.0 it is the users
   responsibility to provide these to COSP. In this driver there are
   examples of how to compute these optical fields needed by COSP,
   which are then passed to COSP.
   *) cosp_test_v2.0.f90      - Main driver code
   *) cosp_io.v2.0.f90        - Input/output module for offline code
   *) cosp_input_nl.v2.0.txt  - Input namelist
   *) cosp_output_nl.v2.0.txt - Output namelist
   *) Makefile.v2.0           - Makefile

*NOTE*
These makefiles build the interface to COSP, not COSP itself. Be sure
to build build the COSPv2.0 source code BEFORE building the interface.
To build COSPv2.0 from this directory:
   make -f Makefile.v1.4 cosp
            OR
   make -f Makefile.v2.0 cosp
You can also build COSPv2.0 in the src/ directory:
   make install
