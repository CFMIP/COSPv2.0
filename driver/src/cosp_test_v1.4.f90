     ! *NOTE* These construct subroutines are different than the original construct 
     !        subroutines provided with cospv1.4.0. The old subroutines required the 
     !        derived type cosp_config to be provided, which was used to determine which
     !        simulators were to be run. For simulators that were not run, a minimum
     !        amount of space was allocated for that simulator.
     !        In COSPv2.0, which simulators are run is determined by looking at which
     !        output fields are allocated (i.e. if the output field for the modis tau vs.
     !        cloud-top height joint histogram is allocated, we know that the ISCCP and
     !        MODIS simulators need to be run). This change in v2.0 makes the way that
     !        the simulators outputs were allocated in compatable, so these subroutines
     !        needed to be modified, albeit only slightly.
