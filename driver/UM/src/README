Overview:
This directory contains example code on how to call COSP2. Provided are two interfaces, both
demonstrating different ways to call COSP2:

1) COSPv1.4 Interface (cosp_test_v1.4.f90)
   This driver makes use of the derived types and subroutines used in COSP1 and maps them
   onto COSP2 input/output structures. This allows the user to call COSP2 just as COSP1.
   Essentially, this driver can be thought of as a COSP1 wrapper around COSP2.
   *) cosp_test_v1.4.f90      - Main driver code
   *) cosp_io.v1.4.f90        - Input/output module for offline code
   *) cosp_input_nl.v1.4.txt  - Input namelist 
   *) cosp_output_nl.v1.4.txt - Output namelist
   *) Makefile.v1.4           - Makefile
   *) cosp_defs.h             - File needed for preprocessing
   
2) COSPv2.0 (cosp_test_v2.0.f90)
   This driver illustrates how to directly call COSP2. However, it should be noted that in
   this example, the same microphysics assumed in COSP1 are used here (e.g. SCOPS is used to
   draw subcolumns). We encourage users to provide COSP2 with as much information from the
   host-model as possible.
   *) cosp_test_v2.0.f90      - Main driver code
   *) cosp_io.v2.0.f90        - Input/output module for offline code
   *) cosp_input_nl.v2.0.txt  - Input namelist
   *) cosp_output_nl.v2.0.txt - Output namelist
   *) Makefile.v2.0           - Makefile

*NOTE*
These makefiles build the interface to COSP, not COSP itself. Be sure to build build the
COSP2 source code BEFORE building the interface.
To build COSP2 from this directory:
   make -f Makefile.v1.4 cosp
            OR
   make -f Makefile.v2.0 cosp
You can also build COSP2 in the src/ directory:
   make install
