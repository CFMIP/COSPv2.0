Overview:
This directory contains version 2 of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project
Observational Simulator Package (COSP2).

The code in this directory depends on
two model-specific files in ../model-interface which may be edited for
consistency with the host model.

cosp.f90 contains
 *) type(cosp_grid_inputs)  - COSP inputs directly from model state
 *) type(cosp_inputs)       - COSP inputs derived from model state (optics)
 *) type(cosp_outputs)      - COSP outputs
 *) cosp_simulator          - Main cosp engine
 *) cosp_init               - COSP Initialization
 *) cosp_errorCheck         - Error checking for inputs
cosp_config.F90 include configuration information needed by the host model and COSP
                 (e.g. joint-histogram bin boundaries)
cosp_stats.F90 contains statistical subroutines used by multiple simulators
                 (e.g. Joint-histogram computation)
