Overview:
This directory contains version 2.0 of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project
Observational Simulator Package (COSP2)

Directory contents:
cosp.f90: Contains the following subroutines and derived types:
 *) type(cosp_grid_inputs)  - COSP inputs directly from model state
 *) type(cosp_inputs)       - COSP inputs derived from model state (optics)
 *) type(cosp_outputs)      - COSP outputs
 *) cosp_simulator          - Main cosp engine
 *) cosp_init               - COSP Initialization 
 *) cosp_errorCheck         - Error checking for inputs
cosp_config.F90: Configuration information needed by the host model and COSP
                 (e.g. joint-histogram bin boundaries)
cosp_stats.F90:  Contains statistical subroutines used by multiple simulators
                 (e.g. Joint-histogram computation)
hooks/:      Contains information (e.g. physical constants) shared thourghout all of COSP2.
