Overview:
This directory contains the main cosp engine (ie. the piece of code
that calls the individual simulators), configuration information and
code common across simulators.

Contents:
cosp.f90: Contains the following subroutines and derived types:
 *) type(cosp_grid_inputs)  - COSP inputs directly from model state
 *) type(cosp_inputs)       - COSP inputs derived from model state (optics)
 *) type(cosp_outputs)      - COSP outputs
 *) cosp_simulator          - Main cosp engine
 *) cosp_init               - COSP Initialization 
 *) construct_cospIN        - Allocates derived (optical) inputs to COSP
 *) construct_cospstateIN   - Allocates model field inputs to COSP
 *) construct_cosp_outsputs - Allocates COSP outputs
 *) destroy_cospIN          - Deallocates derived (optical) inputs to COSP
 *) destroy_cospstateIN     - Deallocates model field inputs to COSP
 *) destroy_cosp_outputs    - Deallocates COSP outputs.
 *) cosp_errorCheck         - Error checking for inputs
cosp_config.f90: Configuration information needed by BOTH the model/testcode
                 and the individual simulators is declared here
		 (ie. histogram bin boundaries)
cosp_stats.f90:  Contains statistical subroutines used by multiple
                 simulators (ie. Joint-histogram computation)

Subdirectories:
simulators/: Contains interfaces between COSP and the simulators, in
             addition to the individual simulators.
rng/:        Contains code to generate random numbers.
optics/:     Contains code for computing the derived optical fields from
             the model state. Called by subsample_and_optics in example
	     interfaces.
hooks/:      Contains code that is used by all of COSP
subcol/:     Contains code used to generate sub-columns
