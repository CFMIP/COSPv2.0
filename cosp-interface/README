Overview:
This directory contains codes that act as interfaces between the host
model (or testing codes) and COSP.

Contents:
cosp_interface_v1p4.f90: Interface between COSPv1.4.0 and model/test.
                         It should be noted that the core of COSP is
			 v1.5.0 and this interface is essentially a
			 wrapper around v1.5.0. This is done to
			 preserve backward capability with v1.4.0.
cosp_interface_v1p5.f90: Interface between COSPv1.5.0 and model/test.
cosp_defs.h: Pre-processing file that contains the microphysical
             scheme used by the radar simulator, quickbeam.
